DELinks is an iOS application that serves as a collection of useful links and features for the Duke Nicholas School's Duke Environmental Leadership Program.  It was built by Duke junior computer science majors Matthew Tse and Andrew Shim for Anthony Garza of the Duke DEL program.  

DELinks is built using Apple's Xcode coding interface and using Apple's objective-C and Cocoa Touch programming languages.  In addition, it relies on several frameworks that are included in the project directory: AWSiOSSDK(framework to interface with Amazon S3 image server), MBProgressHUD framework for showing statuses on the screen, SVWebViewController framework for providing UI back-forward buttons.

To deploy the project, one needs to download the source code to XCode.  From there, one can simply run the project in XCode's simulator, run it on a provisioned device, or send it to the App store for approval.  Here is a link to apple's process for app store submission http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/YourFirstAppStoreSubmission/AboutYourFirstAppStoreSubmission/AboutYourFirstAppStoreSubmission.html.
