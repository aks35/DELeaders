# Backlog

Here is a list of backlogged features that we would like to implement in the future:

* Android App
* Website version of the application
* Auto sign in for Duke Library website using stored netID
* make app extensible for adding new icons/links
* integration of Sakai web elements with iOS native calendar
* better use of screen real estate in main links page
* encrypt stored Duke netId and password
* move hard-coded URLs and other such strings into XML
* refactor Sakai login functionality
